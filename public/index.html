    <!-- Story Paragraphs -->
    <p>
      In a world overflowing with information, clarity is your greatest asset.
      From late-night ideas to mid-meeting insights, thoughts often vanish before we can act on them.
      What if there was a space — just yours — to preserve every thought, every plan, every learning?
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s where the Note-Making App comes in. Whether you’re a student managing lectures, a developer planning logic,
      or an artist sketching your next masterpiece in words — capturing ideas is non-negotiable.
      Our platform is your digital vault — reliable, distraction-free, and easy to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thousands have made the switch from scattered thoughts to structured success. The journey of clarity starts here.
